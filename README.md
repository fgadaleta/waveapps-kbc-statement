# Usage:

Download statements from KBC touch (http://kbctouch.kbc.be/) as csv file

Run the script to transform the original list of statements in something that Waveapps can understand and 
parse correctly

``` python kbc_to_wave.py -i export12345678.csv -o export12345678_wave.csv ```

Now you can `Upload a Bank Statement` from your Waveapps dashboard using file `export12345678_wave.csv`
